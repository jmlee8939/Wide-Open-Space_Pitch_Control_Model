    This example will show how to load data from Metrica's EPTS files directly into a pandas
    frame using some internals, which allows us to read other sensors than the speed sensor.

    We include 4 steps in this example:
    1. Loading the meta data from the XML fil
    2. Trying to load the raw data from a single sensor and discover what consequences the
       usage of generators are.
    3. Find out how we can iterate over the records and show what's in such a record
    4. Try to consume items from generator twice
    4. Convert the records into a pandas dataframe for easy data mangling

        # Why did this happen? Well.. `records` is a generator. A generator is a 'lazy list' which will produce
        # results when we ask for it (when we loop over the items). The `epts_read_raw_data` generator will
        # in its turn only consume data from `raw_fp` when we ask for new records.
        # So as long as we don't consume items from `records` no data is consumed from `raw_fp`. Performance wise
        # this is great! We don't load all data in memory.
        # But this also means `raw_fp` needs to be consumable (file may not be closed) before we consume
        # all items from `records`.

    # step 3: this works
    with open("epts_raw.txt", "rb") as raw_fp:
        # we are only interested in the data from the 'speed' sensor
        records = epts_read_raw_data(raw_fp, metadata, sensor_ids=["speed"])

    data_frame = DataFrame.from_records(records)
    print(data_frame.head())
    # Empty dataframe? Wut? Well.. a generator can be consumed only once. The for loop above already consumed
    # all the items.

    # step 5: put the records in a pandas dataframe
    with open("epts_raw.txt", "rb") as raw_fp:
        # we are only interested in the data from the 'speed' sensor
        records = epts_read_raw_data(raw_fp, metadata, sensor_ids=["speed"])
